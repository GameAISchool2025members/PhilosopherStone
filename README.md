# The Philosopher's Stone

<p><em style="font-size: 0.9em;">🏛️ A Chilling Party Game of Philosophy and Deception</em></p>

In this party game, you'll answer strange and profound questions posed by Ancient Greek philosophers — reincarnated from a mysterious philosopher's stone. But there's a twist:

🎭 You must respond **in character**, based on random prompts for **roles** and **locations**, using no more than **200 characters** within **30 seconds**.

🤖 At the same time, an **AI agent** will also answer the question.

Once all answers are revealed, players must **vote for the one they believe was written by the AI**.

## 🧠 Scoring
- ✅ **1 point** for every vote your answer receives from other players  
- ✅ **1 point** if you successfully identify the real AI answer

Can you outwit the machine — and your friends?
